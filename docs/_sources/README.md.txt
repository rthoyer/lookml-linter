# LookML Tools

This repository contains some tools to handle best practices of a set of developers working on LookML files.

There are three tools: 

 - `LookML updater`
 - `LookML linter`
 - `LookML grapher`

Sites:
 - source: https://github.com/ww-tech/lookml-tools
 - documentation: https://ww-tech.github.io/lookml-tools/
 - Pypi: https://pypi.org/project/lookml-tools/

## LookML updater
The first tool helps solve a problem of official definitions of `dimensions` and `measures`&mdash;such as in a business glossary&mdash;getting out of sync from some other system. The solution implemented here is to have a remote master list whose definitions are propagated to LookML. Thus, given some remote definition for a given LookML `dimension`, `dimension_group`, or `measure`, inject it in the LookML.

Full documentation is [here](README_UPDATER.md).


## LookML linter
The second tool helps us check that our LookML conforms to some given coding standards and LookML developer best practices. It runs a series of checks over our LookML files and reports which `files`, or which `dimensions`, `dimension_groups`, or `measures`, fail those checks.

Full documentation is [here](README_LINTER.md).

## LookML grapher
The third tool creates a "network diagram" of the `model - explore - view` relationships and writes to an `PNG` image file. The code will also identify any `orphans` i.e. views not referenced by any models or explores.

Full documentation is [here](README_GRAPHER.md).

## Installation

For the grapher, you will need to install grapviz:
```
brew install graphviz
```

For all tools, you will need to install dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can install the Python codebase of `lookml-tools` via pip:

```
  pip install lookml-tools
```

One user reported having to install a specific version of pandas (`pandas==0.24.0`) to make this all work. YMMV.

Alternatively, you can install with
```
  python setup.py install
```

## Unit tests
There is a test suite with close to 100% code coverage

Run with 

```
pip install pytest-cov

python -m pytest --cov=src/ test/*.py ; coverage html
```

## Developer Notes
There are some developer notes for the linter [here](README_DEVELOPER.md).

Grapher: title now exposed as an option

Grapher can now create animated GIFs

#### 2019-09-28: 2.0.3

setup.py now uses find_packages()

#### 2019-09-28: 2.0.2

Added missing __init__.py so that packages are recognized

#### 2019-07-17: 2.0.1

Adding missing `lkml` to `requirements.txt`

#### 2019-07-17: 2.0.0

Given the impact of the following two changes, this is a major release:

 - swapped out the node-based LookML parser with [Josh Temple's](https://github.com/joshtemple) new Python lkml parser (https://pypi.org/project/lkml/). This simplifies install, dependency management, and underlying parsed JSON format.
 - added layer of abstraction via `LookML` and `LookMLField` classes so that rules and other code can query LookML attributes via methods instead of inspecting raw JSON.

Other changes:

 - `src.RuleFactory` is now a singleton so it is easier for users to register their own rules.
 - Can now parameterize any rule in the configuration by adding additional keys to the dictionary for that rule.
  For instance, if the config defines `{"name": "MyAwesomeRule", "run": true, "debug": true, "strict_mode":true, length: 6}` then this whole dictionary is passed into the constructor during rule instantiation.

#### 2019-06-10: 1.0.0
 - initial release
